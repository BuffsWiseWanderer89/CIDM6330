# A problem for which a designed software system could assist in improving or solving
A small beach cleanup program relies on volunteers to collect, count, and dispose of discarded cigarette butts. The manual counting portion of this process proves to be time consuming. Other methods of measurement are either difficult or imprecise such as visual estimation or measuring by weight as the butts can be of varying sizes and can sometimes be waterlogged. Manually counting requires physically touching the butts is also undesirable and unsanitary for volunteers.

# The domain of practice or interest in which this problem is situated
This domain of practice for this problem is environmental advocacy and tracking. It will require knowledge in at least and not limited to: 
	1. Mobile app development
	2. Image recognition
	3. Cloud storage and Processing
	4. Backend and APIs
	5. Dashboards and Analytics
	6. Location Services

Many of these areas can be vertically integrated using google cloud platform but there are other services available as well. If we want to have cross platform viability with a single codebase then I will likely need to learn React/Javascript.

# Your personal/professional interest in this problem domain
I am a volunteer Treasurer for the Galveston chapter of the environmental advocacy group, Surfrider Foundation. One initiative unique to our chapter is the 'Hold On To Your Butts'. National headquarters has mentioned in roundtable meetings about using our local initiative as a pilot for a national beach cleaning app for Surfrider. The scope will eventually be larger as the foundation protects not just beaches but all waterways and resources in each given chapter's area. For example, our chapter's zone covers from bodies of water from Dallas west to central Texas down the Louisiana border and to Freeport.

# What sort of system you want to prototype that would allow you to better understand the problem, problem domain, or design considerations thereon.
I want to prototype a mobile application that makes it easier and more efficient for volunteers to collect cigarette butts. The basic premise is that volunteers can take photos of the butts collected using a dedicated mobile application on their smartphone that will upload the images to a cloud based image recognition program to count the number of butts collected which will then feed data into a postgres database and then a live online dashboard.
